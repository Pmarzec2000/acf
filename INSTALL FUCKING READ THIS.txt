INSTALL:

Make a folder in your server (or your client) Addons folder named ACF. As you used an svn program thus far to download this readme, i'm sure you can figure out how to install the main acf folder.

After doing that, take the following folders and place them in the addons folder (they shouldn't be in the main ACF folder)

ACF Buoyancy tool
ACF Fading door
ACF Fallen's Tools
ACF MakeSpherical
ACF Offroadwheels
ACF steering wheels

Note: MakeSpherical is updated in this version. You may have it already but this is an updated version.

After you've installed those folders, take the following folders and put them in the MAIN GMOD DIRECTORY:

Scripts
Particles

ACF WILL NOT HAVE SOUND IF YOU DO NOT INSTALL THOSE FOLDERS INTO THE MAIN GMOD DIRECTORY FOR CLIENT -AND- SERVER!



SERVER OWNERS: If you have the tools included with acf already, please delete the duplicates and/or don't install the corresponding acf folders
