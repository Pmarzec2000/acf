
The trunk folder is the main ACF folder. Install it to your (or the server's) addons folder. Install it and rename the folder ACF.

Take the scripts & particles folder from the ACF folder and place them in the main garry's mod directory. THIS IS IMPORTANT. ENGINES AND GUNS WILL NOT HAVE SOUND IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS FOR CLIENT -AND- SERVER

Place the external ACF tools in the Addons folder where the ACF folder is.
